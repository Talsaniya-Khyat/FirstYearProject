                        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                        <p>McDonald's Corporation is an American-based multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as
                            a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United
                            States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company
                            into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in
                            Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc (1902–1984), a businessman, joined the company as a
                            franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's
                            had its previous headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to
                            Chicago in June 2018.</p>

                        <h2> First of all, why McDonald’s?</h2>
                        <p>McDonald’s is a well-known food chain company which has its outlets all around the globe. Its
                            golden arches are well recognised everywhere. It has its footprints in over 100+ countries.
                            Currently, McDonald’s has around 38,000 stores and serves 7 crore people every day. These
                            numbers are huge enough to let you know why McDonald’s is one of the best options when it
                            comes to owning a restaurant as a franchisee.
                            Currently, McDonald’s is operating through two companies in India. These two companies
                            operate in different regions in India and you would need to contact them for a franchise
                            agreement and process.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> North and East region - To open a McDonald’s restaurant in the North or East region of
                                India,
                                you need to contact Connaught Plaza Restaurants Private Limited. This company was
                                previously
                                owned by Vikram Bakshi, however, now it is completely owned by McDonald’s holding
                                company. All
                                the McDonald’s restaurants in these two regions are under this company or any franchise
                                is
                                approved by this company only.</li>
                            <li>South and West region - To open a McDonald's restaurant in the South or West region of
                                India,
                                you need to contact Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt. Ltd. For any franchise-related query,
                                you would
                                need to contact this company for the South and West regions.</li>
                            <li> To get an idea of the terms and conditions of owning a McDonald’s franchise, you can go
                                through
                                their Franchise Disclosure Document, which is a document of about 350-400 pages. To
                                understand
                                it, you might need to talk to your lawyer and accountant as well. You will get a good
                                idea about
                                franchise working and T&C from this document.</li>

                                <li> BFL Franchise</li>
                                <p> Business Franchise Leases are provided to corporations to establish
                                    canteens
                                    in their offices. Such outlets are initially offered on a 3-year lease but can be
                                    extended
                                    depending upon response and maintenance.</p>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Well, so far these were only franchise fees we have talked about. Other than this you
                                would
                                need
                                around 6.6 Cr to 14 Cr INR investment for equipment, maintenance, staff training, and
                                other
                                expenses for setting up a restaurant. Moreover, you would also need 5 Cr INR liquid
                                capital
                                for
                                any unexpected expenses or safety money.
                                You must be wondering that it is a lot of investment and don’t know how to cover it up
                                and
                                start
                                making a profit. So let us now look at some other benefits of owning a McDonald’s
                                franchise
                                and
                                whether it is worth it or not.
                                You do not have to spend a lot on advertising as your store publicity will be done along
                                with
                                McDonald’s advertisements. You do not need to spend too much on individual
                                advertisements.
                                McDonald’s will also provide you with all the information regarding equipment required,
                                recipes,
                                etc. They will also train your staff in how to operate equipment and deal with
                                customers.
                                If you are thinking that McDonald’s franchise cost is quite high, then look again at the
                                extra
                                benefits you will be getting from the brand with minimal effort. Also, considering
                                McDonald’s
                                brand value, this investment in its franchise is not totally outrageous. Overall, its
                                recognition and love for foods will attract customers and profits for you.</p>
