                        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                        <p>Burger King (BK) is an American-based multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants.
                            Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger
                            King, a Jacksonville, Florida–based restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into
                            financial difficulties in 1954, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton (1927–2018)
                            and James McLamore (1926–1996) purchased the company and renamed it "Burger King". Over the
                            next half-century, the company changed hands four times and its third set of owners, a
                            partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners took it public
                            in 2002. In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company, in a
                            deal valued at US$3.26 billion</p>

                            is
                            required to follow. The same holds for investing in Burger King.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first step that a person has to take in order to become a Burger King franchise
                                owner is
                                to click on the company’s official website.</li>

                                Burger

                                things
                                forward.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Burger King Franchise Requirements</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The franchise has to enlist for a training program conducted by the company itself to
                                help
                                people learn about the fast-food business and the industry. It helps people fully
                                comprehend
                                how to run a burger chain.</li>
                            <li>The next requirement is regarding the location of the restaurant. The company has listed
                                where all a person can open an outlet and this information is divided into three
                                categories.
                                The first category includes institutional locations like bus stations, airports, train
                                stations, metro stations, sports arenas, government building areas, etc. The second
                                category
                                includes commercial areas like shopping malls. The third category includes
                                non-conventional
                                areas like gas stations, grocery stores, etc.</li>
                            <li>Another requirement is that a franchisee needs to use the outlet for the single purpose
                                of
                                running a Burger King restaurant. The restaurant has to be open for the minimum hours
                                listed
                                in the franchise agreement.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Burger King Franchise Cost in India</h2>
                        <p> Burger King franchise costs around $3,398,600 in the US. So, the amount of money that a
                            person
                            needs to invest in order to become the owner of a Burger King franchise in India comes to
                            over
                            20 crores. Apart from that, the individual needs to pay a royalty fee as specified by the
                            company.
                            Burger King is definitely one of the most expensive franchises to own. By now you know that
                            getting this franchise can be lucrative yet costly. However, rest assured that you will get
                            maximum support from the Burger King franchisor. Because this food chain has a brand value,
                            you
                            are less likely to incur losses.
                            Ongoing Fees For Burger King Franchise and Other Charges
                            After you have assessed the total cost of setting up a Burger King franchise in India, you
                            can
                            start running your business. But you need to be aware of certain ongoing expenses like:</p>
                        <h2>1. Royalty</h2>
                        <p>The franchisee needs to pay 4.5% of the monthly gross sales to the company as royalty.</p>
                        <h2>2. Advertising Cost</h2>
                        <p>The franchisee needs to spend about 4% of the total gross sales on advertising of their
                            Burger
                            King restaurant/outlet so that people in a particular location know about its existence.</p>
                        <h2>3. Building Improvement and Maintenance</h2>
                        <p>This one is an optional expense. You can personally choose not to take up this expense. But
                            as
                            we are elaborating on Burger King franchise cost in India, it is worth listing. For building
                            improvements and maintenance, you need to spend between $500 and $700 (although the cost may
                            slightly vary depending on the location).</p>
                        <h2>4. Tax</h2>
                        <p>If you open a small franchise, then you may not have to pay taxes. However, for a great
                            franchise such as Burger King, you need to pay taxes to the government. The tax percentage
                            varies from place to place. On average, a Burger King franchisee has to pay 18% tax to the
                            Government of India.</p>
                        <h2>5. Training</h2>
                        <p> you open a Burger King restaurant, you are required to hire new staff. As this
                            franchise is
                            a huge brand in itself, there are strict quality guidelines that need to be followed by
                            every
                            owner in any part of the world. To ensure the quality standards are met, the company offers
                            quality training to staff members. The training program costs around $2500.
                            Before you open an outlet, you must finish this training program. Usually in India, the
                            training
                            program takes place at the Burger King franchise head office in Mumbai.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Burger King Franchise Profit Margin</h2>
                        <p>There is no fixed number or statistic to underline the lucrativeness of a Burger King outlet
                            in
                            India. The franchise is growing real quick and gaining popularity all across the country.
                            Sales
                            amounting to Rs 375 crore rupees in 2018 indicate that Burger King will prove profitable for
                            an
                            individual wanting to own a Burger King joint.
